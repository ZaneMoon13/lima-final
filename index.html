      <h1>Welcome to <b>LIMA!</b> The final project for CIS 376!</h1>
      <p>See an example of poor design and some prototypes to fix it:</p>
      <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
        <li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#home">Bad Example</a></li>
        <li><a data-toggle="tab" href="#menu1">Good Example</a></li>

        <div id="home" class="tab-pane fade in active">
          <h3>Bad Example of Game UI Design</h3>
          <img src="imgs\destiny_2.jpg" alt="Destiny 2's Inventory System" class="image">
          <!-- Take Input From User  -->
          <h3>Well what's wrong with it? :</h3>
          <p>As seen in the image above, Destiny 2 struggles with conveying the information neccessary to new players looking
            at their inventory system to understand the context of the equipment the player is equipping. Stats like Intellect, Discipline, Recovery, have no
            meaning to a new player when he/she/they first log into the game for the first time. <b>This is a problem.</b> The symbols that may be found on every single piece
            of equipment have very different meaning behind them, but is trapped behind four different menus that you have to treverse to see the meaning. This is
            horrible deisgn. A user friendly UI would have a simple mouse over on each stat/symbol/etc. to convey the information quickly instead of forcing
            players to look online or in the thousands of pages of jargon in the menus. The numbers to the right of every skill also gives no context of what the player
            is going to be recieving with the equipment. For example: What does +8 in Mobility mean? 10% speed? 10% acceleration? Who knows. That's why it's <b>poor UI design.</b> 
            A good player of a video game wants to know what they are equipping before blindly equipping weapons and armor that may be worse then the gear they currently have. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>We will make a prototype to fix Destiny 2 in the next tab above.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- GOOD EXAMPLE / PROTOTYPE -->
        <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
          <h3>Prototype to Fix Destiny 2</h3>
          <img src="imgs\destiny_2_prototype.jpg" alt="Destiny 2's Inventory System" class="image">
          <h3>Why is your idea so much better then what is there now? : </h3>
          <p>Well. I hate to burst any bubbles... but as Conor McGegor once said: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF_udGNzkNA" target="_blank">"I'd like to take this chance to apologize...
            to absolutely no body!"</a></p>
          <p>All jokes aside- I believe that this design will help newer players and older players when picking up Destiny 2. Destiny 2 is a game where one will play for around 150~
            hours over the course of a couple of weeks and not play it for months afterwards. Both new and old players have to suffer through learning what every stat does, every symbol means, etc.
            and it makes the game a chore to play rather then fun. This proposed idea fixes any and all problems I have pointed out in Destiny 2's UI.
